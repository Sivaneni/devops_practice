To send and receive traffic across this VPC peering connection, you must add a route to the peered VPC in one or more of your VPC route tables

			DEFAULTVPC(ROUTE TABLE OF THIS NEED TO ACCEPT CONNECTIONS FROM DEMOVPC)
			DEMOVPC(ROUTE TABLE OF THIS NEED TO ACCEPT CONNECTIONS FROM DEFAULTVPC)



ephemeral ports:

clients connect to a defined port and expects a response on an ephermeral port

ASG cannot be created for instances created in DEMOVPC(created by us)?
 and why?
